# YahooFinanceWebScraping

In this small Python project, we are attempting to extract basic financial data of major players in the automotive market. To gather this information from Yahoo Finance, we will utilize web scraping libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup.

Finally, we will store the raw data in a CSV file for cleaning and analysis later on !
